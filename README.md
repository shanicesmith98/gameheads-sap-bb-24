This is a GameHeads SAP Project from Taj, Ka'imipono, Aonee, Shanice, Christopher, Jana, and Donovan.


> In the dialogue-driven simulation game, “Enjoy Your Stay In Paradise,” you get to experience the disconnect between the expectations of tourists and the reality of the locals in modern Maui. You play as Kamiya, a college dropout who works at her family's food truck after the island was hit by devastating fires. Despite the local community still in recovery, the number of tourists continues to increase, leaving Kamiya with the impossible task of providing tourists with an idyllic version of island life that is far from her reality.
